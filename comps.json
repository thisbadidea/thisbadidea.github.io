You\u2019re made of goo, so that\u2019s a lot more difficult than it might sound. In fact, you\u2019re going to get chopped up a bunch. But that\u2019s okay, because you can get big and strong again, so long as you know what you\u2019re doing.\r\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s where these hints, tips and cheats come in. With them you\u2019re going to have a head-start on the competition. Said competition being spinning blades, stomping weights and mesh-nets. They\u2019re still going to get you, but you\u2019re going to know what to do when that happens.\r\n\r\nWhether you\u2019re playing the game for the first time or you\u2019ve been playing for a while, you\u2019re going to find something that\u2019s going to help you out here. Here are the best hints, tips and cheats for Blob Runner 3D.\r\n",
    "slide_title_1" : "1. Grab the goo…",
    "slide_content_1" : "You’re going to want to prioritize grabbing the goo to make yourself bigger. Gems are great and if you can get some too that’s wonderful, but you want to focus on making yourself as big as possible, because that’s going to bag you a higher multiplier when you get to the end of the level.",
    "slide_title_2" : "2. Stay small, sometimes",
    "slide_content_2" : "When there are spinning horizontal blades, sometimes it’s worth avoiding picking up the goo though. The smaller you are, the easier it is to get underneath them, and if you’ve got too much above the blade you can find yourself in real trouble. Staying low is sometimes the way to go.",
    "slide_title_3" : "3. Hit the big hole in the mesh",
    "slide_content_3" : "Most mesh gates have a large square in them – you want to be aiming for this when you’re heading towards them. If you go through the smaller holes you’ll often get cut up too small to continue and that’s going to end your run.",
    "slide_title_4" : "4. Don’t always go for 10!",
    "slide_content_4" : "If you get to the end of a level and you’re not massive, there’s a good chance you’re not going to get all the way to the 10x marker at the end of your leap. Keep an eye on the gauge at the side of the screen – if it gets below half then aim for the highest, closest multiplier, otherwise you might end up with 1x, and that’s a waste.",

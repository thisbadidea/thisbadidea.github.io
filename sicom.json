Once Siri has opened, ask a question or ask Siri to perform a task such as emailing or texting. Siri will automatically detect when you have stopped speaking, but you can optionally press the microphone icon to show you have finished your question or request.

    "slide_title_4" : "4. Take Full Advantage of Alpha Lock!",
    "slide_content_4" : "This tool is perfect for adding shadows, colors, and textures to your drawings. Here’s how it works: first, create your general shape. Then go into your layer menu and select “Alpha Lock” (or, use the shortcut and simply swipe right with two fingers). That way, any details you add will stay within the boundaries of your layer, meaning you won’t color outside the lines of your original shape. “Alpha Lock is one of my secret weapons when using Procreate,” illustrator Jaye Kang tells us. “Everything looks much better when you have that level of control over what you’re creating.”",
    "slide_title_5" : "5. Try Clipping Masks!",
    "slide_content_5" : "The clipping mask is similar to alpha lock, with some key differences. For one, you’ll be working with a totally new layer. That means you can edit your details without affecting your original shape, and vice versa. Simply add a new layer and select “clipping mask.” The base layer will then become a mask, and all your new details will conform to the pixels of the original shape while also remaining independent and easy to adjust. Julia Mello is an illustrator and animator based in São Paulo, Brazil. “I started using Procreate last year, and it would have been easier if I had known how the clipping mask worked,” she explains. “It has sped up my process, allowing me to apply textures and effects to different shapes easily.”",
    "slide_title_6" : "6. Play Around with Recolor Methods!",
    "slide_content_6" : "Interested in adjusting the colors in your Procreate drawing? The app comes with a variety of ways you can quickly, easily try out different colors: Alpha Lock is great for staying within the lines of a particular layer, but it’s also a great way to change the colors within a layer. To try it out, simply turn on Alpha Lock, choose a color from your color menu, and begin coloring over your drawing. The color you’ve selected will stay within your current layer, so no need to worry about coloring outside the lines. You can also choose “Fill Layer” within your Alpha Lock menu to quickly fill the entire layer with a single color. There’s also a tool in Procreate that’s literally named “Recolor”. To find it, open your Adjustments menu — you’ll see the name at the bottom of the list. Choosing the Recolor tool will automatically fill in wherever your crosshairs are on the screen with your chosen color. To change where the color lands, simply drag the crosshairs to a different area or shape on your drawing, using your Apple Pencil.",
    "slide_title_7" : "7. Use QuickLine and QuickShape!",
    "slide_content_7" : "These tools are also easy to use and perfect for anyone who has difficulty drawing straight lines. Simply draw a line (or a geometric shape, like a circle or triangle), and hold your Apple Pencil on the screen after you’re done. The app will automatically perfect the lines and shapes for you. Jill Goritschnig is an illustrator and graphic designer based in Austria. “I wish I had known about the QuickShape feature from the beginning,” she tells us. “It's so helpful for creating straight lines and smooth shapes. It changed how I paint and also the overall look of my paintings. I would recommend it to anybody, especially if you work in a graphic style.”",
    "slide_title_8" : "8. Create a Color Palette Using the Eyedropper Tool!",
    "slide_content_8" : "Have you ever seen an image with a vibrant color that you’d love to use in your own work? Procreate Eyedropper tool makes it easy to grab and save hues directly in the app. To activate Eyedropper, simply tap and hold on the screen over the color you like. You’ll notice that the color dot in the upper right corner of your screen has changed to match it. You can take this one step further, using Eyedropper to create a custom Color Palette for your drawings. Open the color menu, click the plus sign to create a new palette, then tap on the brush icon to the left of your color menu. Now, use the same tap and hold technique to activate the Eyedropper, moving it around on the screen to pick up different colors. Every time you find a color you like, all you have to do is tap you Apple Pencil within your new palette to save it!",
    "slide_title_9" : "9. Export as PSD!",
    "slide_content_9" : "Exporting your files as PSD allows you to keep your layers intact. Dream up things to draw on your iPad, and when you’re ready, send your work to your desktop computer for advanced editing. Animator and designer Danni Fisher-Shin has been using Procreate for years now, and one thing she loves is how the app has evolved in just a brief time period.",
    "slide_title_10" : "10. Follow Procreate on Instagram. !",
    "slide_content_10" : "This suggestion comes from Valeria Frustaci, an Italian illustrator based in Brooklyn. “They share a lot of tips and tricks every week, and you can also ask questions,” she explains. “By checking in on Instagram, I have learned shortcuts I didn’t know before, and it’s helped me with my illustration process overall. Everything is easier and faster now.” Watch the highlights, too. “I would highly suggest checking out Procreate’s Instagram highlights,” Brooklyn-based graphic artist and lettering designer Walid Bukhari says. “They have clips for basic tricks and mini tutorials. I’ve learned a ton of features that way, and it has definitely helped my productivity.”",

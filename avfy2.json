    "slide_title_5" : "5. Avatarify on Zoom, Skype, and Teams?",
    "slide_content_5" : "First spotted making rounds on Twitter, Avatarify is one such AI tool that allows a user\u2019s face to superimpose onto a picture creating a movable avatar of that person. This movable avatar can then be used in some of the famous video meeting\/conferencing apps like Teams, Zoom, and Skype.\r\n\r\nThough the tool was released on 12th April this year, it didn\u2019t gain a lot of popularity. But, this tool is gaining popularity after Ali Aliev, one of the tool\u2019s developers, posted a video on the installation process of the program on a PC.\r\nIn the 13-minute how-to-install video, developer Aliev explained each step of the installation process. Want to cut it directly to check the tool\u2019s working, seek to 9:45 mark of the video.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Aliev, it is suggested to have the mentioned specifications on your PC, i.e., a GPU, for running the program smoothly. As the developer explained, the tool can run at 33FPS with an NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti and at 15FPS with an NVIDIA GTX 1070. The program will run at 1FPS with a MacBook Pro without a GPU. That is why the program needs a CUDA-enabled (NVIDIA) video card, without which, the tool uses the PC\u2019s processing power and gives unsatisfactory results.",

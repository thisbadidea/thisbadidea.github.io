Many call Avatarify the face moving app. This is an apt name for the application as it provides various photorealistic avatars that can be used for social media posts and also as avatars for video conferencing apps such as Zoom, Skype, Teams, and more.\r\nThe users of this application can use any image, whether it be of some celebrity or someone they know, then they can record a short video of themselves and the application\u2019s advanced neural engine will put these expressions and emotions onto that image, making it the real face moving app. It has a few avatars of popular people that users can use from the start, they can also add new avatars by copying them and adding them to the avatar\u2019s folder. This application has been developed by independent developer Ali Aliev.",

    "slide_content_2" : "Avatarify App is new and adds a whole new array of features that some users might have a hard time figuring out. Check out how to use Avatarify App below:\r\nSelect an Image\r\n\r\n    The users should first select the image they want to animate, this image could be of any person they want it to be, the only catch being the face should be clear and should fit to scale to provide the optimum results.\r\n\r\nRecord a Video\r\n\r\n    This is an important part, the users will have to record a video and the image will mimic those expressions and emotions, so the users should practice well before recording their final cut. Users can also use preexisting Gifs to animate their images too.\r\n\r\nAnimate the Photo\r\n\r\n    Lastly, the users can let the application\u2019s advanced neural network take the steering wheel and animate the image with expressions and emotions chosen.\r\n",
